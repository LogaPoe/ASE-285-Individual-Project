Planning the Individual Project
Summary of the Project
This project is about creating a way to handle user login information. I will make a key and lock, containing user valuable login infromation.

Goals
The main goal of this project is to creat a secure credential system for users.

Why?
This project teaches the importance of security, and how to implement it in your projects.

 

Features
Direction: In this section, write down the summary of features and discuss how these features are combined to give value to users or what problem to solve. Think of this as a simple report to stakeholders who don't have time to read the documents made by team members

Project Test Plan
Direction: Team members make unit tests, and team leaders make integration, regression, and acceptance tests.

Integration tests if two or more modules are interacting correctly, regression tests are to check if changes won't break the previous codebase, and acceptance tests are to check if the requirements are met or not.

Milestones and Deadline
Specify when to build a prototype, ver1, and final version

Some of the milestones should include the implementation of requirements and/or tests.

Project Progress
Feature Implementation
Team leaders summarize each team members' accomplishment in this page weekly and use it to present to stakeholders.

Week 1?
Project starts at week 10, so we start writing down our progress. Team leaders will use this section to report to the stakeholders on Wednesday's scrum meeting.

As a professional, it is important to make progress and make it known to others (especially to your team leader and managers). So, make the report every week. You can delete any part of the report if it is irrelevant.

Summary
Direction: Write a simple summary of what you accomplished (make code/tests/document/design, solve problems, learned something, have a meeting or anything related to the project) in this week

Milestones or risks in this week
Check if you completed milestones and/or how you dealt with the risks. Be sure to write down the dates.

Make a record of which requirements/tests (if you did) were implemented this week.
